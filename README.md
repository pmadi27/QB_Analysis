# NFL Quarterback Draft Analysis

## Overview
This project explores how well college performance predicts NFL success for quarterbacks drafted in the 1st and 2nd rounds since 2004. Using web-scraped data and a custom scoring system, we analyzed each quarterback's transition from college to the NFL and grouped them into four categories: **Flops**, **Expected**, **Surprising**, and **Overachievers**.

## Motivation
Every year, NFL teams invest heavily in drafting quarterbacks, but not all top picks deliver on their promise. We wanted to understand:
- Which QBs lived up to their college hype?
- Which ones outperformed low expectations?
- And which ones fell short, despite being highly drafted?

Our goal was to analyze trends and identify if there‚Äôs a more data-driven way to predict quarterback success in the NFL.

## Methodology
- **Data Collection**: Webscraped a list of all QBs selected in the 1st and 2nd rounds of the NFL Draft from 2004 onward.
- **Metrics**: Gathered key college and NFL statistics such as passer rating, total yards, touchdowns, and playoff performance.
- **Scoring System**: Created a point-based model to evaluate QB performance at both levels.
- **Categorization**: Compared scores to determine whether QBs were:
  - **Overachievers** ‚Äì Exceeded expectations based on draft position
  - **Surprising** ‚Äì Outperformed expectations despite a modest profile
  - **Expected** ‚Äì Performed in line with predictions
  - **Flops** ‚Äì Failed to meet expectations

## Visualizations
- Scatter plots comparing college vs. NFL performance
- Highlighted breakout and disappointing QBs
- Category-based charts for intuitive analysis

## Key Takeaways
- Not all highly drafted QBs succeed.
- Some QBs with modest college resumes end up thriving in the NFL.
- External factors like coaching, scheme fit, and injuries play a significant role in development.

## Tools Used
- Python
- R
- Web scraping with BeautifulSoup and R
- Git & GitHub for version control and collaboration

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate more advanced stats
- Analyze differences based on system fit or coaching staff
- Expand to include later-round QBs or non-drafted players
